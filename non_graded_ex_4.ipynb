    "    4.10 Ask the user to pick one card from their own deck to fight the opponent's card. \n",
    "    4.11. REPEAT THE SAME LOGIC AS STATED FROM POINT 4.4 TO 4.5.3. But this time, from the perspective of the opponent.\n",
    "    4.12. After the opponent's turn is over, display that a new round will begin in some seconds.\n",
